	Reduce from $A_{\TM}$. To determine whether \TM\ $M$ accepts $w$, construct \TM\ $N$ which always accepts $\TT{01}$ but accepts $\TT{10}$ if and only if $M$ accepts $w$.

	Reduce from $E_{\TM}$. To determine whether \TM\ $M$ accepts nothing, construct \TM\ $N$ which simulates $M$ on $N$'s own input $w$ but never writes a blank symbol over a nonblank symbol unless when $M$ accepts.

	\item[5.13]
	Reduce from $E_{\TM}$. To determine whether \TM\ $M$ accepts nothing, construct \TM\ $N$ which simulates $M$ on $N$'s own input $w$ and obviously has no useless state except the one $q_{\RM{accept}}$.

	Let $M'$ be $M$ after modifying all its transitions $\delta(q_i,a) = (q_{\RM{accept}},b,X)$ to $\delta(q_i,a) = (q_{\RM{reject}},b,X)$, and then modifying all $\delta(q_i,a) = (q_j,b,\RM{L})$ to $\delta(q_i,a) = (q_{\RM{accept}},b,\RM{R})$. The problem is now reduced to checking whether $M'$, as a \emph{\TM\ with stay put instead of left} described in Problem 3.13, accepts $w$. It is easy since $L(M')$ is regular by the solution to Problem 3.13.

	Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $BB$ is computable. Then obviously there exists a \TM\ $M$ having $k$ states, which writes $BB(n) + 1$ \TT{1}s on the tape, when given input $\Bra{n}$. Further, using $M$ we can construct a series of \TM s $M_n$ having exactly $k+n/2$ states, which writes $BB(n) + 1$ \TT{1}s on the tape when started with a blank tape. However, then $M_{2k}$, as a $2k$-state \TM , would write $BB(2k) + 1$ \TT{1}s. Absurd.

		\item[$\Leftarrow$:] Trivial, since $\TT{0}^*\TT{1}^*$ is surely decidable.
		\item[$\Rightarrow$:] Suppose there is an $A$'s decider, then $f$ defined as follows is computable.
		\[
			f(x) = 
			\left\{
				\begin{array}{ll}
					\TT{01}, & x \in A \\
					\TT{10}, & x \notin A

	$\overline{E_{\TM}} \Leqm A_{\TM}$ by Problem 5.22 and it is well known that $A_{\TM} \Leqm E_{\TM}$. By the way, it is not difficult to construct an undecidable language $B$ such that $B =_{\RM{m}} \overline{B}$.

	The case $P$ is not nontrivial is trivial. As for the second condition, let $P = \{ \Bra{M} \ | \ \TM\ M \text{ has $100$ states} \}$.

	Let $M$ be a \TM\ which on input $\Bra{x}$ ($x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$) calculates $x, f(x), f(f(x)), \dots$ until it finds some $f^{(n)}(x)	= 1$, and then accepts. Let $N$ be a \TM\ uses $H$ to calculate whether $\Bra{M, x} \in A_{\TM}$ for $x = 1, 2, \dots$ in order, until it finds some $\Bra{M, x} \notin A_{\TM}$, and then accepts. We have the positive answer to the $3x + 1$ problem if and only if $\Bra{N, \TT{0}} \notin A_{\TM}$.

		\item[b.] Reduce from $\IT{OVERLAP}_{\CFG}$ by constructing a grammar whose rules are $G$'s and $H$'s rules and $S \to S_G \TT{\$} \ | \ S_H \TT{\$\$}$, where $S_G$ and $S_H$ are $G$'s and $H$'s start variables.
