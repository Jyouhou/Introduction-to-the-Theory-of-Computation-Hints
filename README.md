# Introduction-to-the-Theory-of-Computation-Hints

This project is supposed to eliminate all difficulties in solving problems marked with stars in Michael Sipser's Introduction to the Theory of Computation Book (3rd Edition). Generally speaking, it does not include those problem answered in the book.

Be careful to read these hints, because they often have enough details. In other words, most of them are eligible to be "sketches of solutions".
