# Introduction-to-the-Theory-of-Computation-Hints

This project is supposed to eliminate _some but not all_ difficulties in solving problems marked with stars in Michael Sipser's _Introduction to the Theory of Computation Book (3rd Edition)_. Generally speaking, it does not include those problem answered in the book.

We highly recommend you to see these hints as _last resort_, because you will _not_ benifit much from simply read these hints unless you have tried really hard to solve those valuable problems.
