# Introduction-to-the-Theory-of-Computation-Hints (Solutions)

This project is supposed to eliminate _all_ difficulties in solving problems in Michael Sipser's _Introduction to the Theory of Computation (3rd Edition)_. Generally speaking, it does not include those problem answered in the book.

We highly recommend you to see these hints as _last resort_, because you will _not_ benifit much from simply reading these hints unless you have tried really hard to solve those valuable problems.
